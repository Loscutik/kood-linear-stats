# Linear-statics

The program reads the data from a file passed as an argument and calculates and prints the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficent.

The data in the file must be presented that way: each integer number in different line

Usage `go run . path_txt_file`

for example `go run . data.txt`

## Testing
You can read the [audit](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/linear-stats/audit) page or follow the steps:

- download the [file](https://assets.01-edu.org/stats-projects/linear-stats) 
- give executable permissions (if needed)
- run the script with `./linear-stats`
- run the program with the created file (data.txt) by the previous command: `go run . data.txt`
- compare results.
